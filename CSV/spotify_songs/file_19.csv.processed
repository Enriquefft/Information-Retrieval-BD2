Fort Minor You ready? Let's go! Yeah! For those of you that wanna know what we're all about It's like this, y'all, c'mon! This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name Mike, he doesn't need his name up in lights He just wants to be heard, whether it's the beat or the mic He feels so unlike everybody else, alone In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary It's all about reality and making some noise Making a story, making sure his clique stays up That means when he puts it down, Tak's pickin' it up, let's go Who the hell is he, anyway? He never really talks much Never concerned with status but still leaving 'em star-struck Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact That many misjudge him 'cause he makes a living from writing raps Put it together himself, now the picture connects Never asking for someone's help, or to get some respect He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist This is twenty percent skill, eighty percent beer Be a hundred percent clear, 'cause Ryu is ill Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames And I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method "Name of the Game"Came back, dropped Megadef, took 'em to church I like "Bleach", man, Ryu had the stupidest verse This dude is the truth, now, everybody givin' him guest spots His stock's through the roof, I heard he fuckin' with S. Dot This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name They call him Ryu the Sick, and he's spittin' fire with Mike Got him out the dryer, he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak What a fucking nihilist, porcupine, he's a prick, he's a cock The type women wanna be with and rappers hope he gets shot Eight years in the making, patiently waiting to blow Now, the record with Shinoda's taking over the globe He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat Tak, he's not your everyday on the block He knows how to work with what he's got Making his way to the top He often gets a comment on his name, people keep asking him "Was it given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?" No, he's living proof, got him rocking the booth He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice Him and his crew are known around as one of the best Dedicated to what they do, they give a hundred percent Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard It seems like he's never got time Because he writes every note and he writes every line And I've seen him at work, when that light goes on in his mind It's like a design is written in his head, every time Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed? Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it? This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name Yeah!

Marco Mengoni Vorrei provare a disegnare la tua faccia Ma è come togliere una spada da una roccia Vorrei provare ad abitare nei tuoi occhi Per poi sognare finchè siamo stanchi Vorrei trovare l'alba dentro questo letto Quando torniamo alle sei Mi guardi e mi dici che vuoi Un'altra sigaretta Una vita perfetta Che vuoi la mia maglietta Che vuoi la mia maglietta Ho bisogno di perderti Per venirti a cercare Altre duemila volte Anche se ora sei distante Ho bisogno di perdonarti Per poterti toccare Anche una sola notte Anche se siamo soli Come l'acqua su Marte Vorrei provare a non amare la tua faccia Ma è come non portare gente ad una festa Ci vuole troppo tempo E noi crediamo nella fretta Cerchiamo voli per andare a Londra Vorrei scordarmi per un giorno di me stesso Quando torniamo alle sei Mi guardi e ti dico Che vorrei un'altra sigaretta Una vita perfetta Vorrei la tua bellezza Vorrei la tua bellezza Ho bisogno di perderti Per venirti a cercare Altre duemila volte Anche se ora sei distante Ho bisogno di perdonarti Per poterti toccare Anche una sola notte Anche se siamo soli Come l'acqua su Marte Potremmo anche restare un po' in silenzio Mentre brucia lenta E non pensarci più Potremmo anche lasciare la paura Chiuderemo gli occhi per saltare giù Ho bisogno di perderti Per venirti a cercare Altre duemila volte Anche se ora sei distante Ho bisogno di perdonarti Per poterti toccare Anche una sola notte Anche se siamo soli Come l'acqua su Marte Duemila volte

Leona Lewis Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen But something happened for the very first time with you My heart melted to the ground Found something true And everyone's looking round thinking I'm going crazy But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing You cut me open and I Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep, keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love You cut me open Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling But nothing's greater than the risk That comes with your embrace And in this world of loneliness, I see your face Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy Maybe, maybe But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing You cut me open and I Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep, keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love You cut me open And it's draining all of me Though they find it hard to believe I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing You cut me open and I Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep, keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love (Ooh, you cut me open and I) Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love I keep bleeding (Oohhh) I keep, keep bleeding love Keep bleeding (I keep...)

Paperwhite Lately I get carried away I've been living too fast And end up sleeping too late And patience is wearing off on me I've been learning to stop And I've been learning to wait And maybe I lost who we are I jumped to the end When that's not how we left it And maybe the sound of your heart Gets stuck in my head So I can't forget When it was only us When it was only us Waiting for a moment away They were pulling us under We got caught in the waves We won't make it I still hear what they said But if we're starting over, I won't listen again And maybe I lost who we are I jumped to the end When that's not how we left it And maybe the sound of your heart Gets stuck in my head So I can't forget When it was only us When it was only us When it was only us Face it, take it We can't fake the fall It's not a race at all It was a wake up call And those vacant spaces It wasn't our fault We were torn apart And now we can't let go of When it was only us When it was only us When it was only us Only Us

Anne Clark Through these city nightmares you'd walk with me And we'd talk of it with idealistic assurance That it wouldn't tear us apart We'd keep our heads above the blackened water But there's no room for ideals in this mechanical place And you're gone now Through a grimy window that I can't keep clean Through billowing smoke that's swallowed the sun You're nowhere to be seen Do you think our desires still burn I guess it was desires that tore us apart There has to be passion A passion for living, surviving And that means detachment Everybody has a weapon to fight you with To beat you with when you are down There were too many defences between us Doubting all the time Fearing all the time Doubting all the time Fearing all the time That like these urban nightmares We'd blacken each other skies When we passed the subways we tried to ignore our fate there Of written threats on endless walls Unjustified crimes carried in stifled calls Would you walk with me now through this pouring rain It used to mingle with our tears then dry the hopes that we left behind It rains even harder now Our Darkness

It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth The minor fall, the major lift The baffled king composing "Hallelujah" Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Your faith was strong but you needed proof You saw her bathing on the roof Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya She tied you to a kitchen chair She broke your throne, and she cut your hair And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah You say I took the name in vain I don't even know the name But if I did, well really, what's it to ya? There's a blaze of light in every word It doesn't matter which you heard The holy or the broken Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah I did my best, it wasn't much I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya And even though it all went wrong I'll stand before the lord of song With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Baby, I've been here before I know this room, I've walked this floor I used to live alone before I knew you And I've seen your flag on the marble arch Love is not a victory march It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah There was a time you let me know What's really going on below But now you never show it to me, do you? And remember when I moved in you The holy dove was moving too And every breath we drew was Hallelujah Maybe there's a God above But all I've ever learned from love Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you And it's not a cry that you hear at night It's not somebody who's seen the light It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah Hallelujah

Gigi D'Agostino I got two strong arms Blessings of Babylon Time to carry on And try for sins and false alarms So, to America, the brave Wise men save 2x Near a tree by a river, there's a hole in the ground Where an old man of Aran goes around and around And his mind is a beacon in the veil of the night For a strange kind of fashion, there's a wrong and a right Near a tree by a river, there's a hole in the ground Where an old man of Aran goes around and around And his mind is a beacon in the veil of the night For a strange kind of fashion there's a wrong and a right But he'll never, never fight over you I got plans for us Nights in the scullery And day instead of me I only know what to discuss Oh for anything, but light Wise men fighting over you It's not me you see Pieces of valentine And just a song of mine To keep from burning history Seasons of gasoline and gold Wise men fold Near a tree by a river, there's a hole in the ground Where an old man of Aran, goes around and around And his mind is a beacon, in the veil of the night For a strange kind of fashion, there's a wrong and a right But he'll never, never fight over you I got time to kill Sly looks in corridors Without a plan of yours A blackbird sings on bluebird hill Thanks to the calling of the wild Wise mens' child The Riddle (Original Mix)

No matter what life wants to throw my way I'll be singing, I'll be singing in the rain Singing in the rain up, in the rain up Singing in the rain up, in the rain up I went to see a fortune teller and she said I'm doomed Oh, no, no, no, no! But what the hell does she know Why she trying to break my groove? Now why she have to break my groove? All of life's colors turn to gray Then you turn around and you smile my way Suddenly all my problems disappear on cue (All because of you) Storm clouds are circling around But I won't let that shit drag me down So I'll be singing (I'll be singing) I'll be singing (I'll be singing) I'll be singing in the rain (Singing in the rain) So I'll be singing (I'll be singing) I'll be singing (I'll be singing) I'll be singing in the rain (Singing in the rain) I've got a song in my heart and I'm bulletproof (Bulletproof) There's nothing in the world that's gonna kill this mood (C'mon!) No matter what life wants to throw my way I'll be singing, I'll be singing in the rain Singing in the rain up, in the rain up Singing in the rain up, in the rain up Even when things shake, earthquake No one can ever steal this smile Even if they fail me And see lately, it's been crazy But it's okay, alright, see everything works And we living life in the fast lane No matter what, I'ma won't change Rock City, not pretty Tell them what, I'ma not stop playing Are you feeling good, feeling great?
