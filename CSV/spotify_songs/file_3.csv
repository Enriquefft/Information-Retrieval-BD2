But change is inevitable One reason we don't like change is we get comfortable where we are. We get used to our friends, our job, the place we live. And even if it's not perfect we accept it, because it's familiar. And what happens is, because we're not willing to change, we get stuck in what God used to do, instead of moving forward into what God is about to do Just because God's blessed you where you are doesn't mean you can just sit back and settle there. You have to stay open to what God is doing now. What worked five years ago may not work today. If you're going to be successful, you have to be willing to change Every blessing is not supposed to be permanent, every provision is not supposed to last forever. We should constantly evaluate our friendships. Who's speaking into your life? Who are you depending on? Make sure they're not dragging you down, limiting you from blossoming. Everybody is not supposed to be in our life forever If you don't get rid of the wrong friends, you will never meet the right friends",0,3IbO0lpV2lzQ5QwOsjFNLk,Ill Mind Of Hopsin 8 - Single,2016-03-08,Urban/Trap - Contemporary RAP,5CK0fshHcik1vWyeCc0zat,r&b,urban contemporary,0.76,0.784,5,-4.87,0,0.331,0.397,0,0.052000000000000005,0.708,126.941,390005,en

1345xOev1kyaeqRdeTxiLi,Life in the Balance,The Four Owls,"Like a leaf clings to a tree The world is well balanced like karma is Do you fight freedom on the front line where the army is Or in your mind opening the left part of this I feel it in-between my bones just like the cartilage When I'm parting this world I won't be sad The true gift was the blessing of life that I've had You can think that I'm mad, Ol' Leaf's on some hippy shit It took a lot of changes in me to consider it Inspired by an old ancient manuscript The Mayans did predict But can you handle it It's a sign of the times that's hidden in the lines The description is what the indigenous define Assure as the sun won't shine, and the rain falling The balance is untold in this life we all in On this misty morning, I zone, at one With the things that molded how I've grown Looking at the bigger picture There'll always be people like Hitler And balancing it out Mother Teresa tryna fix the world Then Ghandi making sure the scales don't tip turn That darker side but thats just the mix in life's elixir Without bad theres no good, without wood theres no fire Without the hood the posh house price wouldn't be higher No stronger no weaker, no stupid no deeper No dick dropping rubbish theres no work for street sweepers Without life there'd be no death And that I don't stop the pain Just concentrate on the memories they left When I'm looking at the stars I realise I'm just a speck on the Earth's surface I measure my worth by my intellect We've all got a purpose, some people got three Some people fall in line and others have got dreams We all do our best with the tools we were given Shit my hammer and chisel is this life that I'm living' Life in the balance, scales of justice Reach for answers, but failed to touch it My mind lost in this, defined by my opposite Life in the balance, rise to the challenge Eight steps away In fact flip that eight on its side Because now I infinitely chase For that intimate embrace with lady luck I mean fuck, how long can someone stay in a rut? I'm like 'no' You see thats all on me, to re-evaluate my goal And forget the greed, but sometimes I think Do I know myself? And if not Is that why I can't control myself? I got a family man I should be responsible Same time mind states held in that constant ball That's why my girls so stressed hey'Cos I get under your skin like an X-Ray But lets pray that it change for the best Deep breath to the chest, now I'm ready for the next day Your in life with the next brain Tryna be the opposite like a sex change Focus head space Its like I'm standin' on the moon staring at the world Tryna work out the balance of this life we hold Its all there is to be encrypted in the Mayan scrolls The cycle of the fifth sun is coming to a close 2012 will only truly show us what that holds The plot thickens as I stand here to break the mold Got my hands out, tryin' not to feel the cold But some people walkin' by are fueled with an icy soul Tools by the side, you take your life for your frigging phone Others feel helpless, the selfless give a child a home Rich feed the rich while the others just apply for loans Money buys everything, but love that's the finest gold I gotta live fast and won't be dying barely old Hedonistic lifestyles reflect how our lives unfold Life is one big cycle like the vinyl spinnin' round it goes And it goes Equilibrium See a billion desperate parts conjoined and deified brilliance Grand amphibians, submerged in slime Emerging like blood when blunt words collide The sun burnt his eyes, the ice sliced his feet to bits But you ain't gotta teach it shit 'Cos the change is instinctual, the pace is unthinkable But never put your faith in a fake individual Balance From the fangs and the mandibles and talons To mannicles and batons to cannons To mechanical contraptions, fashioned out of passion That could turn the Earth back to a burnt black chasm Shit happens Atoms, bound by compassion To fractal patterns I saw spinning In the caverns of my mind once, it all ties up If I could see a bright sky shine when my eyes shut",44,3JitDZ8GaCRvhBGpSDBCBj,Nature's Greatest Mystery,2011-12-05,Saxophone in Hip Hop - R&B Lounge - Jazz Rap,2ujrP2rPxu8ao7wNeG1ZOY,r&b,neo soul,0.6659999999999999,0.84,7,-5.376,1,0.327,0.489,0,0.163,0.6970000000000001,86.66,275827,en

185ZAmEXHzplBXOWqNtwAa,Fire Is Coming,Flying Lotus,"The yellow phone on the wall started ringing. Tommy jumped, then ran across the kitchen and picked up the receiver. ""Hello?"" he said, a little out of breath. Tommy's father was downstairs in the basement wood shop cutting a piece of clear pine on the table saw. The sound of the saw was screechingly loud, and a big plume of agitated sawdust was forming in the air. Tommy's mother was outside on the front lawn tending to a small flower garden. She was visibly upset about her flowers' condition. She was observing a black film on the stems and leaves, then trying to wipe this black substance away while running hose water on it, but it was too greasy, and the water wasn't washing it away. The front door opened and Tommy appeared behind his mother. ""Mom, there's a phone call for you."" Tommy's mom stood up and turned, the garden hose in her right hand shooting water. ""Who is it?"" she asked. ""I don't know. It's a man. He said you would know what it's about."" Tommy's mom stood frozen for a moment, and Tommy saw lines of worry racing across her face. Something else scrambled into Tommy's awareness. He saw that the sky was noticeably darker than usual, and he saw a huge, red-orange glow moving on the horizon. Just then, a man appeared running frantically in the street, the man yelling, ""Fire is coming! Fire is coming! Fire is coming! Fire is coming! Fire is coming! Fire is coming!""
