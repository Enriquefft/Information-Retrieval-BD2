3feSwo9dMR0sbvdPU02xbh,If You Wouldn't Mind,2nd Exit,"But for now, I'll just go, you know? I'll just... Be off Well, wish I could be off but, you know... Been sitting here for like... Over four minutes now Hello, Jubilee Line How's your day? You're ruining mine I thought you were a newer design Couple stops back, you were just fine So fix up, if you wouldn't mind I mean, if you wouldn't mind There's a party and my friends wanna go They all know I'm never involved They all think I'm negative though But if I come, you'd wish you'd left me at home I'm cool, I just can't take people that shout Like what you screaming about? You're holding hands, do you need to be loud? See, this is why I hate leaving the house I'm on the train now and this is what I'm talking about This old man is snoring of course And now, I bet he's dreaming of a mortgage, no doubt Or talking to his ex wife, sorting things out Either way I'll leave him to sleep Got places to go, but its people I'll see Look, I wouldn't be feeling this low But bill collectors, they won't leave me alone They want a fee, that ain't feasible though Can't you see that I'm broke? It's hard to breathe 'cause my bank account's revolting We need to revoke I hate the government, I needed to vote But that's the least of my woes I'm overworked and underpaid Recently it's been worse and I'm afraid I might go berserk and run away With this girl on the Jubilee Line I'm feeling like we're two of a kind I was looking into your eyes and you were in mine I ain't the intuitive kind So speak up, if you wouldn't mind I mean, if you wouldn't mind Good morning grey sky Good morning says I Should yawning mean my day is boring? Could falling in line make clear my calling in time? Is my portion supposed to be awesome? Or should I just settle for sort of sublime? It seems I'm caught in the limelight When all I want is to be courting a wife, right? Nah man! I'm too young to marry Too much to do still, and too old to hang out with Tom, Dick, or Harry I got sick of the toxic spew Coming from the mouth of every hot chick I've got into So I've started answering to Todd, Jack, or Larry And now I don't go out so much I stay home, you could say I'm out of touch And when my friends say, ""have you heard that new album? The one by such and such?"" I'm like, who? And who are you? I've haven't had friends for months I mean, I do have friends They just forgot my name and never come to the ends See, they don't like the train or the track So now I sit alone and pretend That I ever get the Jubilee Line See, I don't see her much of the time I tend to favour Victoria's vibe As if I go out I usually decline I'll stay home, if you wouldn't mind I mean, if you wouldn't mind",0,3OZksagLNqEbzxPgR26xry,2nd Exit,2016-05-27,Saxophone in Hip Hop - R&B Lounge - Jazz Rap,2ujrP2rPxu8ao7wNeG1ZOY,r&b,neo soul,0.7659999999999999,0.5920000000000001,5,-9.894,0,0.29600000000000004,0.6579999999999999,0.0068,0.105,0.833,179.985,238499,en
