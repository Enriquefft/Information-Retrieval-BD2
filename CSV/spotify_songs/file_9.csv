3K90t1MhVMqcpgd95fq6mp,Fly Away,CRUCIFIX,"I love herb, I don't want to fight it so I take that weed and I light it. Ain't nothing in this world to make me want to stay. I want to get high and Fly Away Lookin' back on my life I've come so far from the man that I was... a broken, homeless, hopeless, empty shell, looking for love. I came up out of the gutter with a dream of having some kids, knowing that the life I'd give couldn't be no better than the life that I've lived. But I've got one chance to break this cycle, make right all my wrongs... I swear to Jesus Christ it hurts me just to write out this song. Though everybody's got their demons from the choices we make, we can either burn, learn, run, hide or correct our mistakes. Not caring about life just seemed so simple, shootin' at little kids, until I think about my daughters takin' a bullet for something I did. Then everything that made so much sense is long and forgotten. I hate myself and I can't even remember the reason I shot them, so God tell me... what's love if hate can break it? What's life if death can take it? I don't really believe in life or love... so roll the bud I love herb, I don't want to fight it so I take that weed and I light it. Ain't nothing in this world to make me want to stay. I want to get high and Fly Away I wonder what it takes to be free, crying, confined in my misery. Ain't no pictures of perfected been painted within my history. I'm used to being the subject of peoples aggression, left alone turning to violence and drugs for affection. It's like I'm walking this line between my love and my lust. The streets been calling me for years sayin' ""why'd you forget us?"" I wanna go back so bad, invitation to my casket. It seems I'm torn between the man I am and a man of the past... you selfish bastard. Actin' like my kids ain't enough. They hug me sayin' ""Daddy play with us before we grow up!"" So I throw away this gangsta mask before I watch my daughters grow into women on the other side of a prison glass. All that I ask in this life I've been giving is to give back the life I never had to my wife and my children. I pack a blunt then say a prayer, find shelter from stress... and like Psalm 55 I'm gonna Fly Away and be at rest I love herb, I don't want to fight it so I take that weed and I light it. Ain't nothing in this world to make me want to stay. I want to get high and Fly Away Love is in the air tonight, but I wouldn't know. When I'm lonely, feeling like the world don't know me... there's nothing here for me. Love is just a lie tonight and that's all I know because I'm lonely, feeling like the world won't hold me... there's nobody here for me I love herb, I don't want to fight it so I take that weed and I light it.

Han),Mickey Cho,"'Tis the time to tell a tale too tall Take a tip or two cents from a thought too small Full of insecurity to the teeth trying to take it So it's barenaked so he thought that he could fake it And be found of fear full of force and fury Folly fed frailness the future felt blurry And faith though familiar fell a few feet far The daily dose of daring to do different To make a mark or message the music may be missing A message of Christ a message of life A message of day a message that would burn through the night I'm trying to understand as a young man How to reconcile the Christ in me with who I really am So you call it art, but it's (for) me a music form To give glory to God that's for what I hope Hm... They're expecting perfection So as a fallible man how do you step With integrity and excellence the mistakes are inevitable Every thing you hide it away in a crucible Then fester and boil your inner turmoils It makes your chaos feel your anger and a bit of holy a-h As an architect artist or an actor Do you pin the Christian tag before or after Regardless where I put it I'm Smashed into pudding if I'm far from my release I'll just regain my footing You can call me cheesey you can call me corny But you can't deny the skills and artistry that I be owning In the lavatory trying to comprehend and tell my story From my childhood days to my college dormitory thus This balancing act I can't forfeit Keeps me in check when I'm drifting out of orbit I'm feeling like a giant, taller than Goliath Not because I'm great, but because I'm repping I AM I used to be about only me so defiant 'Til I gave my life away Now I find that I am flying even higher than the sky I'm soaring through the galaxies Fire in my eyes got Summers on the rapper be Inspired by the lines of The Word no blasphemy Tired of the slime put these other rappers after me Tell me what's the aftermath I feel like it's a tragedy The topics that these rappers rap about so casually Sex money drugs Morally decapitating everything I love Can I wave they're gone magically huh? Cause the children are the casualties A tall price to pay like a fish fillet from Applebee's I'm all about the honour The standard that I stand for the higher that the standard is The standard that demands more and I'mma meet the quota A new breed of rapper that will change all the negativity the rappers shown us In an industry full of shallow means to make a profit is an emcee I relent to thee, speaking as a prophet over all the nonsense I could care less if I can make you shake your booty but your soul remains unblessed That's the reason I spit it to the best of my ability Forever I'll be killing these beats yes",36,2e3GHgScDbDUQq2EUpLUHN,Ftk,2013-03-31,Saxophone in Hip Hop - R&B Lounge - Jazz Rap,2ujrP2rPxu8ao7wNeG1ZOY,r&b,neo soul,0.7509999999999999,0.61,2,-8.045,1,0.127,0.35,0,0.353,0.7709999999999999,96.903,170013,en

Evan Roman),Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"I need love You need love Give me love And I'll give you my love They say thirty's the new twenty And twenty's the new thirty, shit I guess Makes sense, 'cause fifteen-year-olds seem twenty And twenty-five -year-olds seem ten I used to drink away my paycheck Celebrate the mistakes I hadn't made yet Our generation isn't the best on safe sex We forget the latex, becoming Planned Parenthood patients Synthetic heroin is the new basehead So much to escape, fuck a straight edge Walk around looking through a fake lens Apps this good, who's got time to make friends? I wish I didn't care If cynical hispters with long hair And cocaine problems, like my music It's not my issue, I can't solve it My flight has finally landed down And the ground has stopped moving all around Eyes open, awake for the very first time We both forfeit this game of crime They say, ""It's so refreshing to hear somebody on records No guns, no drugs, no sex, just truth"" The guns - that's America, the drugs are what they gave to us And sex sells itself, don't judge 'til it's you Ah, I'm not more or less conscious Than rappers rapping 'bout them strippers up on a pole, popping These interviews are obnoxious Saying that ""It's poetry, you're so well spoken,"" stop it I grew up during Reaganomics When Ice T was out there on his killing cops shit Or Rodney King was getting beat on And they let off every single officer And Los Angeles went and lost it Now every month there's a new Rodney on You Tube It's just something our generation is used to And neighbourhoods where you never see a news crew Unless they're gentrifying, white people don't even cruise through And my subconscious telling me stop it This is an issue that you shouldn't get involved in Don't even tweet ""R.I.P Trayvon Martin"" Don't wanna be that white dude million-man marching Fighting for a freedom that my people stole Don't wanna make all my white fans uncomfortable ""But you don't even have a fuckin' song for radio Why you out here talking race, trying to save the fucking globe?"" Don't get involved if the cause isn't mine White privilege, white guilt, at the same damn time So we just party like it's 1999 Celebrate the ignorance while these kids keep dying My flight has finally landed down And the ground has stopped moving all around Eyes open, awake for the very first time We both forfeit this game of crime I need love You need love Give me love And I'll give you my love",39,6XO9dbsH9zhuQgFGH0hUrb,The Heist,2012-10-10,Indie Poptimism,2QiMewRbSavfZ9MSAYz2h6,pop,indie poptimism,0.687,0.736,10,-7.481,1,0.106,0.165,0.00502,0.0711,0.449,101.151,226049,en
