Han tocado en festivales que yo nunca he conocido Pero las noches que lloro, eso nunca lo han vivido Ah, Katana en mano, rap en serio El rap no es un instituto, camarada, es un incendio Tantos raperos de expendio están saturando el medio Ya los habíamos matado desde que se estrenó el premio Yo puro verso oscuro, no te creas fosforescente Metido en el rap y el vicio desde que era adolescente Con estas frases de clase en estas bases excelentes Te hago quedar en verguenza como a Eva la serpiente Abre la mariconera, veamos si es que tienes balas Mienten en lo que rapean y es por eso que resbalan Verdadero hip hop, si es la pregunta no señalan Los kings del underground, y si lo digo, eso les cala Que más da la ropa y si es que se visten de gala Esto lo entenderán cuando lo aprendan a la mala Que no haya sopa en la mesa y ese calor no se iguala Cuando ??? un bajón al día y mires que nada se regala Si juntan un par de días creamos un city express Hicimos un estudio dentro de un city express Por estos malos raperos fue que adquirí estrés Productor para ??? rap, me dividí en tres Solo hay tres cosas que te hacen perder el juego Amigos por una ruca, las carreras por el ego La tercera es más que obvia, estoy hablando del dinero Muchos creen que lo es todo; yo no lo amo, lo quiero Estoy hablando literal, vamos a ver cuántos rapean Es tu tercer strike y aquí se van si no batean Yo he visto como suben y aquí arriba se marean También a la misma sangre, como entre ellos se balean (Tun tun tun tun, no peleas con honor El frío nubla tu juicio) Pero vaya balacera si entramos en la cabina Le reviento la bocina, la sonora dinamita A este proyecto de textos que la escena necesita Le meti todos los pesos igual que a las maquinitas Yo no publico mis amores ni tampoco mis romances Se que los destruiría si eso estuviera a su alcance Hay quien me quiere ver con cáncer, otros trepando en un Lancer Unos quieren mil putas, otros una que los abrace Todavía tengo noches de depresión y de insomnio Ya tiene mucho tiempo que no creo en los unicornios La vida es pasajera igual que los matrimonios Así que trabaja duro para pagarte el velorio Yo! Soy garantía como una movie de Al Pacino Lo que escribo, no lo entienden, pensarían que es pa' chinos Les emputa ver cómo subimos Ni les caigo ni me caen, pa' que fingimos Pocos como nosotros que tienen hits ahí afuera Y que en una batalla se miden contra cualquiera Si tu crees que es mentira te apuesto la cartera A que te sobran dedos, los contamos cuando quieras Pocos como nosotros que tienen hits ahí afuera Y que en una batalla se miden contra cualquiera Si tu crees que es mentira te apuesto la cartera A que te sobran dedos, los contamos cuando quieras",31,4f0iuEJ66gNenOENDbjva8,Faruz Vs.

63G6iIKfvS3CxMU34SuhbI,Latinoamérica Morena,Rapper School,"NA Canserbero (Venezuela) Yo no canto por cantar Sueña y serás libre en espíritu, lucha y serás libre en vida Porque es mejor morir de pie que vivir toda una vida arrodillado Voy sin mirar estos volúmenes Soy de un barrio humilde, sencillo aquí donde tu me ves La calle te devuelve el doble de lo que tu le des Por eso sé más a menudo cortes fúnebres en túneles Que! Si tú no conoces caes y ya no saldrás Allá en mi ciudad no voltean ni para mirar atrás Pero me siento en casa junto a mi raza Vengo de un Perú padrino donde pocos se disfrazan Yo vengo de las calles grises, de Lima donde pocos son felices Pero subiendo a la tarima en rima puedo dar matices Donde hay cárceles sobrepobladas, zombies en las madrugadas Gente desinteresada que te da el apoyo a cambio de nada Donde sicarios impera - pera, llueven balaceras - ceras Donde el barrio está caliente, hay guerra de adeveras - veras Santa Cruz mi cuna somos todos bajo la luna Haber nacido en este lado del mundo es una gran fortuna Desde Chile a México es el léxico latino Trajimos el auténtico y frenético estilo Que barrio en los barrios su sonido Barriendo lo cosmético el ejército de rappers que ha venido Como Bolívar y Guevara cantando la patria Como Sábato dando palo al madafacka El rap nunca murió, se fue a territorio sudaca Y detonó como una bomba vietnamita contra Satán Ya no hay nada que! paren a este R.A.P Párate! morena las salve en el parlante Karates! liricales salen de este para que Los males sales de tus mares, se valen cada vez Latinoamérica morena como mi madre Somos lo mismo en esta Tierra, basta mirarse Pal mundo entero del Chile verdadero Desde Conchalí salido, yo nací y crecí acá en el ghetto V.Z.L.A negro, crecí en los paisajes maracayeros De los valles aragüeños Aquí fue donde comenzó este sueño Abrocha el cinturón y con gusto te lo enseño Su ubicación excéntrica más bien hay réplicas Es auténtica, diversidad cultural y ética Aparte de bellas mujeres activas y enérgicas Y las mejores playas de toda Latinoamérica Nadie puede negar que mi Tierra es muy hermosa Pero para variar no todo es color de rosa Pues cuando la tarde se muere y la noche se esposa Decenas terminan en una fosa de manera forzosa Nos confunden con la tele y los periódicos Pero también existe gente honesta, honrada y con una propuesta Aquí un botón para la muestra Bienvenido a Venezuela disfruten el viaje y manténgase alerta Vengo de América morena, mestiza, guerrera Soy una mezcla de sangre nativa, africana, europea Una historia de traiciones, amor, furia y retazos El resultado de mis glorias y mis fracasos Vengo de una América en estado crítico Golpes de Estado disfrazados de demócratas cívicos Presidentes elegidos por casting Impuestos por el Norte eso a fuerza de Marketing Ellos manejan, manipulan tu mentalidad Amoldan a su conveniencia eso que llaman realidad Atemorizando a todo aquel que les resulte un obstáculo Para sus fines bélicos nos toman por estúpidos Nos informan y nos mienten sin escrúpulos Nos quieren imponer un modelo ético y estético Que un indio presidente se convierta en icono Les duele y los humilla como patada en los testículos Yo creo en mi Tierra que no se vende Las caras lindas de mi gente negra siempre al frente Aquel muchacho llamado Ernesto Nos dijo: ""si el presente es lucha, el futuro es nuestro"" No hay enemies contra ningún país No hay fuerza que separe a un MC y su raíz Tierra, cabo y maíz me hacen sentir feliz Latinoamérica tatuada como cicatriz Ronton de sueños y ronton de balas Ronton de madres que lloran por panas Ronton de kilos, ronton de montañas De gente que te odia y de gente que te ama Eso es Latinoamérica morena, donde opera un sistema Que al hombre envenena y lo lleva pa' la tristeza extrema Pero el latino no se deja porque los problemas se convierte en libros para un poema Porque nos corre por las venas el fuego que quema a su opresión Y ahí nos temurouticos en la jugada Multiplicándonos llevando la che a lo madafe En mí que hip-hop y un café fue lo que traje Un sentimiento venero con la clave Defendiendo la sazón y las costumbres Por generaciones la sangre y la tierra nos une Hay que chambear por la evolución de nuestra causa Alimenta el alma también la mente luego descansa Porque como dijo mi compadre En estas calles, la balas no tienen nombre Los tiempos de la selva han vuelto en este siglo Así cualquier habitante es un blanco posible y continúa el ciclo Pero esto nos fortalece y nos define Nos da el carisma y caminamos firmes Por un futuro libre, el legado no se extingue Nadie nos quita lo bailado, así de simple Bienvenidos a mi pueblo latino Todos buscando plata, un mejor destino Crecí entre malos barrios y las ventas del vecino No hubo jardines finos ni tenis nuevos de niño Santa Suerte pa' mi pueblo mexicano Todos trabajan duro, nadie se levanta en vano Misión llevar sustento pa' tu madre o tus hermanos Unos en la oficina, otros con pistola en mano Mal no! pero aquí nadie lo predice Y en lo único que creo es cuando mi abuela bendice Me dice que no aterrice, que lo que quiero lo hice Y que mi música latina por todo el mundo deslice Si no que muestre cara y represente Que me mantenga libre, les cante honestamente Que si lanzas una piedra la mano enseñes de frente Y que confíe en mi gente pero nunca en presidentes Bubo dijo que rapeara duro que no perdone Que me mantenga lejos de to' esos mariposones Que se posan en las flores solo cuando hay néctar Rap de Acosta para los conocidos soy Edgar Música selecta desde los casetes Me hice rapero temprano porque no tenía juguetes Mama dice que no use chupete Que hay que gatear para correr y pa' llegar a coronel, primero ser cadete En esta mierda desde el 97' Cuando los cuellos pa' arriba, el aviso y un afilado machete Si sabes compa mejor que interprete Que el diablo sabe lo que sabe por ser un loco diablodete Yo no soy ni seré el que más le mete Pero siempre en órbita sin NASA y sin cohete Siguiendo migajas de rap como Hansel & Gretel Y el que me quiso estafar... pa' que respete La gente piensa que yo soy huevon Porque canto hip-hop de rap revolución De corazón te lo juro por mí song Que si siguen irrespetando sabe bien el freno del camión ¡Qué está pasando camaleón!
