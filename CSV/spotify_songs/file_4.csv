Do you believe in rock 'n' roll Can music save your mortal soul And can you teach me how to dance real slow? Well, I know that you're in love with him `Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singing Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" Now for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh, and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned; No verdict was returned And while Lennon read a book on Marx The quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died We were singing Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and falling fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now the half-time air was sweet perfume While the sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance! `Cause the players tried to take the field; The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died? We started singing Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on: Jack be nimble, Jack be quick! Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the devil's only friend Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in hell Could break that Satan's spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died We were singing Bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play And in the streets: the children screamed The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken;The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most: The father, son, and the holy ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died And they were singing And there I stood alone and afraid I dropped to my knees and there I prayed And I promised him everything I could give If only he would make the music live And he promised it would live once more But this time one would equal four And in five years four had come to mourn And the music was reborn Bye-bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die.""

1FLZRn9a9x8GIuWorOIetk,My Universe,La Coka Nostra,"Intro:Do I live in a friendly or a hostile universe? Which is it? Is it a universe that is filled with hostility and anger and people wanting to hate each other and people wanting to kill each other, is that what you see?

You can't tell me nothing motherfucker It's my universe The universe is ruled by the strong The strong prey on the weak The sky's owned by the dawn ??(This is a lesson, so follow me Let's travel at magnificent speeds around the universe) In this world there's only one way out Close your eyes then You're in the lion's den in a state of zazen The black hearse is occupied, watch the tires spin An old man with a whiskey-nose and hard chin Looks across the scene It's a scene he seen before Since a teen he's seen the war Bullets careening off the walls To the car that's speeding off Blood on the asphalt Families dress in black for the son they had the mass for The young man inside the casket this time? That's George 'far as the old man can see, he got what he asked for He knew him as a youngin and he schooled him to the game His tutelage had brung him ‘til he grew to live the same As an older gangster gentleman but barely in his 30s The whole city was burning, but Georgie kept earning He was ambitious, too ambitious Man the kid was so determined Now he's laying in the casket while the priest offers a sermon He let his future rock inside the cradle of fate Made a deal with the enemy, that was a fatal mistake When you're a rat you better watch what you say to a snake Or your family will stand around you while you lay at your wake See the neighborhood's violent Mother is silent with loneliness He fills the priest's coffers and he offers his condolences Gets inside his Lincoln While you presume the worst...

I'm lookin for Someone to marry me, take care of me and bury me, these days thats a rarity But i can guarantee, if I broadcast live from deep within me, God will send me Someone only divinity could ever get the credit for, and I can take her from the Hood to the Gucci store. God gave her a O.G for a daddy, bad broad for a mama From tank tops and thongs to the Prada pajamas and i'ma, be awake when i'm supposed To be asleep cause my mind's on my money and I know when i'ma reap what I Sew. I'm a beast that should be heavily medicated, huh, that's therapy to me i'm just Dedicated, motivated by the thoughts of empty mouth, nightmares of comin' home to An empty house. I know what it is to see somethin' fade on Titanic and built a castle And watched it collapse in front of me My, daughter, she survived the tragedy, the, aftermath at my attempt at a family. So Don't sit up here and talk about what I already know or sit up here and act as though You will never go. Like you will never ever pack your bags and leave I'm not comparin' You to her it's a reaction to me. People take all they can take and I just run 'em away Even I can't believe some of the stuff that I say. The holes in the walls can easily be Fixed with mud, the holes in us can only be repaired with love and they can only be Mended, they can never be fixed because people forgive you, but they can never forget....

No trust. Other than my trust in God cause everyone I ever trusted, has broke My heart. I keep my guard up and it could never be lowered and you could never sucker Punch me, i'm forever lookin for it. You go through the bad just to get to the good somethin I wish more people understood..... I'm Hard 2 Love Some say I'm hard to like But i've been through a lot of things That i'm scarred for life.

Dang, they probably got grandkids I say, People don't love like that these Days. Bet you quick to say forget it, turn away and leave it to the porno where their love Is nothin' but an image, lights and smoke, two-way mirrors so the people on the outside don't See errors till you can no longer create the facade and need to talk to everybody about it but God She gon' make mistakes but so will you. You shouldn't say nothin' that you wouldn't want Her to, say to you if you was in the spot she's in. Love, makes acception and, takes direction Baby girl just hold me down for now before you know it you'll be married to a hole in the ground....
