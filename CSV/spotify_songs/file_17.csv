So welcome home All the light fades to dark All that's good gets torn apart Why is this feeling of loss like a welcome home? So welcome home And those dirty little whispers, demon's voice in my head Angel over my shoulder, evil needs to be fed Hot flashes turn cold as day turns to night My head starts to ache because something's not right Pour salt in my wounds, I'm cut deep inside Battered and bruised, bones breaking, teeth bite Tattered and torn, pour gas on my life You can burn up the book, but the pages survive The smell of rain in the sky The tears are gone, the well is dry Why is my feeling of loss like a welcome home?
