1YC6QGUV2IppNyNJHjr29n,Papa Was A Rolling Stone,Was (Not Was),"It was the third of September That day I'll always remember, yes I will 'Cause that was the day that my daddy died I never had a chance to see him Never heard nothin' but bad things about him Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth Mama looked up and said son Papa was a rolling stone Wherever he laid his hat was his home And when he died all he left us was alone Where the hell are you daddy, that's what I'm sayin' Down on my knees and tears and I'm prayin' Wishing and hoping my dreams could come true So I could feel like the other kids do A young child but not complete as a whole Before I was born you up and strolled Mama was there but you was up in the wind You never even knew my name and then You never wrote, called, let alone came by As a youth it was hard to wonder why But now I'm older and I don't dwell on self pity Thinking about the life you didn't give me I remember when I used to tell lies When people would ask I'd just fantasize Thinking of stories to make you look good But the real truth was you was never no good People would say I looked just like you But rest assured I don't act like you I'm more than that, my mama raised me better And you can best believe I'm much more together So belive that Mama is it true what they say That papa never worked a day in his life? And mama there's some bad talk goin' round town That papa had three out-side children And another wife, and that ain't right Heard some talk about papa Doin' some store-front prechin' Talking about saving souls and all the time leaching Dealin' in dirt and stealing in the name of the Lord Mama looked up and said son Papa was a rolling stone Wherever he laid his hat was his home And when he died all he left us was alone It's been said you gave me something you never had But that's not always true and it's sad To find myself missing you when I did But who knows the reasons why you did what you did I can't help but wonder why You lived your life as a big fat lie You act like you had no responsibilities 'Cause if you did it's a bet that you wouldn't be Stealin' beggin' hustlin' and schemin' You could'a got a job But did you know the meaning of work I'm talking about an honest day's pay But you was too lazy to be that way Always trying to take the easy route That's what they tell me, so I don't doubt It for a moment, not for a sec Because you lacked all your self respect But it's too late for you that is Tomorrow I'll be going on about my biz And so it's time to put the past behind Erase the anger and clear my mind I want to forget the little bit I know And make sure that I never sink so low 'Cause I want my kids to grow up and know That I was always there because I loved them so And that's the least thing that I can do But that's a lot more than I got from you I heard papa call himself a jack of all trades Tell me is that what sent papa to an early grave? Folks say papa would beg, borrow or steal To pay his bills Hey mama, folks say papa wasn't much on thinkin' Spent most of his time chasing women and drinkin' Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth Papa was a rolling stone Wherever he laid his hat was his home And when he died all he left us was alone",31,37HwHnmQGmcAMH27bUZ2Ob,The Collection,2004-01-01,"Swingbeat (old skool), New Jack Swing, R&B, Hip Hop, Urban",3krpccUV68nBGAQbvHEZDC,r&b,new jack swing,0.821,0.79,10,-9.019,0,0.0645,0.0883,2.18e-4,0.0552,0.6559999999999999,115.214,404733,en
