Si ya las vomitaste antes, eso se llama resaca Transito en la cloaca Subo mis hombros me escondo en el fondo Me hundo en mi casaca (acá la cara se tapa) Para la alharaca flaca Sólo voy pa la casa pa la cagá Sin backup, sip, se me cayó la capa Mi sonrisa es más tímida q un beatmaker Soy feliz sintiendo amor de los haters Saca el shaker ! Por los q viven sin deleite Y por ellos nadie da un veinte Llevo escondido en el bolsillo.... Un poema en seis versos, son la punta del iceberg Que llevo bajo mi abrigo Digo con mi voz sin vigor ""el rap más que un amigo Es un gran país, man"" Peace! para todo aquel que la busca Si ya no está en su boca Deja que el vodka la induzca Que reconozca que le gusta La vida nos mata a todos: Es la industria de la angustia Solo quiero regresar a mi hogar Dialogar con los pajaritos Y abrazar un par Perpetuar tu arte Cuando al cuarto antes Radiante ibas con el alma Para tatuarte Paso. paso a paso Trazo frente al ocaso Hago un repaso Del fracaso El triste último abrazo Vuelvo a casa Acaso hay caso .. Acaso sigo muerto? No hay un local abierto En medio de este desierto Quiero echarme entre los libros y botellas Hincharme en su recuerdo Ver la tele y verla a ella Quiero gritar! Que el viento que me apaña Me pueda llevar De bar en bar De par en par que se abra mi alma Pa sangrar!
