I'm all for looking hard at things that need to change, but first the fiction has to be knocked out of the discussion. Let me set a few things straight. First off, this article is irrelevant and outdated. Perhaps if these journalists had written this twenty years ago, when the truth was a little more ragged, they could have made an argument that wasn't so laughable. Back when warehouses were being broken into, fire codes were ignored, dodgy generators were powering a massive sound system and restrooms were non-existant. This was a time that safety probably wasn't exactly job one. Things were smaller then, though. There weren't tens of thousands of people looking to gather in one place, not like now. This scene has grown, and in response to the people it serves, it has grown up. Today, massive events are being held on terms that have been scrutinized by engineers, civil servants, fire chiefs, policemen, and all manner of bureaucratic safety hoops. As EDM's numbers have become larger, we've become more accountable. No longer hiding in an abandoned warehouse, we're paying taxes, paying dues, and stimulating the hell out of each cities' economy that hosts an event. Before the doors ever open, there is a string of green lights that have to be run through by people whose business it is to keep these events safe. The same codes put into place for every other genre of music applies to EDM. To say otherwise is untruthful and adheres to dangerous stereotyping.I wouldn't dare say we ignore the tragic accidents that happen. I wouldn't dare say they don't happen. But it takes a rudimentary understanding of the Basic Laws of Probability to guess that the more people that show up to these festivals, the larger the risk is that something goes awry. This isn't unique to this music. This is a universal principle. Can we hope to avoid it? Absolutely. Can we take every precaution and security measure to hedge the odds? Definitely. But can the promoter be held responsible for the actions of the individuals at his events? No he can not. What it comes down to is this: The responsibility to address substance abuse and addiction cannot come down to people who are event promoters. Not only is it unrealistic to expect them to tackle such a huge problem, it's an enormous insult to those who have made it their life's work to do so. Clearly, if the US Government hasn't come up with the magic bullet to quell the problem of drugs in this country, it is not reasonable to expect an event promoter to pull this kind of trick out of his hat either. I am dug in so deep that articles like this one, smacking of uninformed bigotry fire me up in a pretty passionate way. To assign responsibility of regulating drug use to concert promoters is ludicrous, in the extreme. To paint a picture (bordering on hysteria) of a community of people as capricious and reckless drug users is irresponsible. This is a conversation that has been going on for decades. I don't expect it to end here. But know this: as far as a music culture goes, EDM is the one who will accept the kids on the outliers, the ones who get bullied, the ones who feel like they may not quite fit in. This community is exceptional in its ability to bond all types together, and I am not exaggerating when I say it saves lives. Our audience is intelligent and kind, discriminating only in regards to which sound they like best. Our audience is unprecedented in their drive to proactively support each other.

The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure ""I'll do years if I pull this trigger"" So he cold dashed and ran around the block Cop radios in to another lady cop He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister Shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her Looked 'round good and from expectations So he decided he'd head for the subway stations But she was coming and he made a left He was runnin' top speed 'til he was outta breath Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him Then he made his move to an abandoned building Ran up the stairs up to the top floor Opened up the door there, guess who he saw? (who?) Dave, the dope fiend shootin' dope Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap He said ""I need bullets, hurry up, run!"" The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun He went outside but there was cops all over Then he dipped into a car ‒ a stolen Nova Raced up the block doing 83 Crashed into a tree near university Escaped alive though the car was battered Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered Ran out of bullets and he still had static Grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead He told the cops ""Back off or honey here's dead"" Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong So he let the lady go and he starts to run on Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded And before long the little boy got surrounded He dropped his gun, so went the glory And this is the way I have to end this story He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh Just another case about the wrong path Straight and narrow or yo' soul gets cast Good night (Knock him out the box, Rick Knock him out, Rick)- Oh boy, that Uncle Ricky is really weird - I know right what does he mean “Straight and narrow or yo' soul gets cast""? - I don't know, I think he be crackin' it up or something - Well, good night - Good night Another (that's right!)
