Soms kan ik door mijn werk niet mijn ruggengraat bewegen Maar dat heb ik er voor over, ik hou mijn baas tevreden Alles is perfect, ik heb helemaal geen stress Heel mijn leven gaat te gek, shit wie hou ik voor de gek! Ik zweef in mijn gedachtes, alles is zo twijfelachtig Onzekerheid is een groot gedeelte van mijn karakter Soms lijkt het makkelijk voor me. Je ziet me blijven lachen Want ik verberg in feite mijn ware zijn met grappen Ik snap het even niet, hoe moet ik me voelen? Hoe moet ik me uiten? Je ziet me lachen met verdriet Mijn ouders zijn gescheiden, m'n moeder zit in de struggle En het is alweer een tijdje sinds ik papa heb gezien Had ik een slecht rapport gaf hij me klappen met de riem Dus om de zoveel maanden kreeg ik klappen met de riem Ik zat alleen maar in de les te tekenen Kreeg ik punten voor tekenen dan verdiende ik makkelijk een tien Ik had geen talent en mijn pa die was een beetje streng Hij zei me vaak verman jezelf, jongen wees een vent, je lijkt op je moeder Mama zei weer dat ik leek op hem Geen wonder dat ik tegenwoordig zo onzeker ben Ik geef mezelf bloot als ik een track tot leven breng Geef een pen en ik beschrijf voor jou wat ik beleef en denk Mijn shit is niet voor op TV bestemd Ik ben niet commercieel genoeg, ik rap niet alsof ik een player ben Nu heeft Gino ineens de meeste fans, voordat ik die Gino-shit deed Was ik als mezelf nog niet eens bekend En nu ben ik ineens de man? (huh?) nu komen rappers slijmen Maar ik voel me nog die domme nigger met die slechte cijfers Vele zeggen dat ze me tracks begrijpen, zeggen Fresku je brengt echte feiten Je inspireert me met teksten schrijven Ik ben geen zeikerd, het is fijn om die respect te krijgen Maar geld heb ik weinig, dus het is fijner om een cheque te krijgen Soms zit ik heel de dag voor de buis en bijna iedereen zijn clip ziet er patserig uit Dan denk ik: jongen wanneer zet jij stappen vooruit en pak je de buit ze lachen je uit Ik flip hem door, en maak dan ruzie met mijn vrouwtje Maakt het uit en loopt naar buiten, maar ik heb al spijt als de deur achter me sluit Ze is een lieve meid en ik wil er voor haar zijn Als deze bij me weg gaat spring ik voor de trein Ze zegt ik ben te dominant en ze heeft gelijk Door mijn onzekerheid raak ik deze meid zeker kwijt Gelukkig is ze lief, een engel vergeleken bij mijn ex Want die ex van mij ging regelmatig vreemd bij mij Sterker nog als je in Eindje een groepje niggers ziet staan Heeft ze op zijn minst met twee gebald en een gepijpt (tfoe!) Me mattie Chico zei me Fres vertrouw geen ene bitch Ze breekt je hart en dan begrijp je de betekenis Je bent wat je eet, sommige dagen eet ik niks Andere dagen een pizza slice en een beetje chips Ik zoek naar evenwicht mijn leven is zonder belevenis Mijn moeite levert niks, ik kan niet tegen dit Als alles tegen zit en ik van binnen sta te koken Kan alleen mijn ma me troosten, door mijn moeder gaat het over Maar ik zie mijn moeder huilen en ik raak mijn focus kwijt Maar houd mijn trots en veeg haar tranen weg zodra ze komen Ik twijfel of het beter wordt, maar zal het haar beloven Het komt wel goed geloof me, ze moet het maar geloven Ze houdt niks over en ik baal ervan Ik wil haar helpen, maar twijfel of ik mijn eigen huur betalen kan Ik werk en werk en soms vraag ik me af Moet ik zo een type zijn die ik beschrijf in 'slavengedrag' Ik verlies al mijn principes want ik baal elke dag Vandaar dat ik snak naar adem als ik slaap in de nacht Mentaal ben ik zwak, ik maak muziek want daar ligt mijn kracht Zo draag ik mijn lasten over naar mijn naasten Zodat ik niet verdwaal op mijn pad, want ik raak in de war En twijfel aan elke stap omdat falen niet mag, dus samengevat: Soms zit ik maar te denken en komt alles op me af En dan voel ik de stress, vandaar dat ik twijfel Het enige wat mij nu nog kan stoppen op het pad Die ik bewandel onderweg naar succes, is mijn eigen twijfel Voor zij die aan me twijfelen Twijfel je meer aan mij dan mij ik betwijfel het Eigenlijk weet ik niet wat ik moet op de wereld Maar ik ben er en ik zit alleen te twijfelen Voor alle mensen die twijfelen Kom je daarmee verder nee ik betwijfel het Eigenlijk weet niemand wat je moet op de wereld Maar je bent er en je moet niet zoveel twijfelen Nee, nee je moet niet zoveel twijfelen Nee, je moet niet zoveel twijfelen Dus voor zij die aan me twijfelen Twijfel je meer aan mij dan mij ik betwijfel het",44,0VPK9rRn6KeNwwFpKY6cnW,Fresku,2010-01-01,Hip-Hop 'n RnB,0275i1VNfBnsNbPl0QIBpG,rap,southern hip hop,0.654,0.917,10,-5.249,1,0.32,0.187,2.05e-6,0.0821,0.447,93.1,315893,nl

""Have faith and trust in me,"" she said and filled my heart with life ""There is no strength in numbers.
