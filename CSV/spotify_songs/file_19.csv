Sip another drink so you can hold on, hold tight Hoping that you'll find a little piece of daylight Go light your spark, set fire to the dark You'll see that all the shadows lie behind you Go make your mark, it ends where you start The night is new There's a light in every hollow where the sun comes shining through It'll find you down the river when you are left black and blue There's a light in every hollow, like the world you never knew There's a place where days are golden, right here, waiting for you There's a light, there's a light, there's a light in every hollow.

Stitch 'em back together, and I swear you'll see it Blowing up in smoke, it's like you're barely breathing Every breath you take, just know your heart's still beating Go light your spark, set fire to the dark You'll see that all the shadows lie behind you Go make your mark, it ends where you start The night is new There's a light in every hollow where the sun comes shining through It'll find you down the river when you are left black and blue There's a light in every hollow, like the world you never knew There's a place where days are golden, right here, waiting for you There's a light, there's a light, there's a light in every hollow.
